ADT LAB score board
===================

These are scripts that generate scoreboard for the UVa tasks at [ADT Lab course](http://theory.cpe.ku.ac.th/wiki/index.php/Adt_lab).

It uses APIs provided by [uHunt](http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/), and
also the task file is a modification from the one in the 
[adt-lab-viewer](https://github.com/atkpwn/adt-lab-viewer) project by
Attakorn who is the course TA.
